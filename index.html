							<p>Ever since I was young I've been smitten with computers. Raised in a family of software developers, I had an early exposure to Linux, often tinkering with it on spare laptops left around the house. I didn't start writing programs in earnest until my senior year at Colts Neck High School, where I took AP Computer Science and learned Java.</p>

						<div class="content">
							<p>At Hamilton College, I am completing a Computer Science major and a Music minor, and will get my B.A. in May of 2020. As a Computer Science student, I learned Python and C++, and gained exposure to functional and object oriented programming. I also garnered a foundation in Database Theory using MySQL and XML. In my own time, I taught myself JavaScript, Node.js, and other packages like Express to help make me a better full-stack developer.</p>

							<p>I have been an intern at IDTech Camps and AT&T as an undergraduate student. At IDTech Camps I taught Computer Science to middle and high schoolers, often using my own review materials and syllabus. At AT&T, I developed an interest in Data Science and Data Analysis, writing a web crawler which tallied and sorted error messages. I also wrote applications and libraries which are still in use at Hamilton College, and am an avid developer and maintainer of open source software, which you can find <a href="http://www.github.com/matthewjenkins97">here</a>.</a></p>
