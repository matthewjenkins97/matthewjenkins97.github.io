			<h1>Hello!</h1>
		</div>
		<p>I'm Matthew R. Jenkins, and I'm a Software Developer and musician currently located in Fitchburg, WI.</p>

		<p>I was a student at Hamilton College from 2016 to 2020, graduating with a B.A. in Computer Science and a Minor in Music. I have had several fruitful internships, including ones at Hamilton College, AT&T, and IDTech Camps. At present, I'm currently working at Epic Systems in Verona, WI as a Software Developer!</p>
		
		<p>I specialize in web development with a MERN stack (MySQL, Express, React, Node.js), OOP (C++ and its derivatives), scripting languages (Python, Javascript / Node.js), and markup languages (HTML, LaTeX). I also have experience with Linux, virtualization using VMware, data science languages (R, Python), and functional programming.</p>

		<h1>Appraisals</h1>

		<p><q><i>Matthew has certainly demonstrated that he can work effectively both on his own and as a team member. In addition, he looks for his own solutions to resolve any challenges or roadblocks he may face when working through a problem. He was dedicated, focused and had the ability to work effectively with all members of the team ... Very little guidance was needed and Matthew did an excellent job of understanding requirements in order to complete [his] projects.</i></q> - 
		John Applegate, mentor at AT&T</p>
