I slept in an air mattress last night at my sister's house. I woke up at 3 am. I don't ever intend to, sometimes whatever higher power exists thinks that by waking me up at that ungodly hour they're inconveniencing me. They obviously did. I tried to go back to sleep, but it failed somewhat miserably (it was so bad that I ended up waking up my sister). At 5 I thought that there was no point for me being at her apartment, so I packed everything I had up, wrote a letter telling her that I was grateful for her letting me sleep there for 2 nights, and left. I got McDonalds coffee and an egg sandwich, mostly because they were the only ones crazy enough to be serving food at 5 am. If you can't tell by now I value my sleep. Maybe a little too much. <br>

My drive was a 2 hour cruise-control-laden drive back to my summer research. I've started to regard Clinton, NY as my home, even though I've somewhat appropriated it as my home. Having an upbringing in Suburban New Jersey makes you feel like anything is more exciting and more worthwhile than your own mansion. And while it's nice to come back every so often, I never feel tied to the ground there. I never really did. The escapism was always prevalent. <br>

Nothing noteworthy happened on the drive. It was very sunny, although some parts of the interstate had fog and random bits of horrible visibility. I kept myself sane by listening to Mark Kozelek's Little Drummer Boy live album. Up until recently I think he's had very few missteps in his career (although that's not including the self titled Red House Painters albums - they're too long for my tastes). I got home at 7:30, and immediately napped until about 12. <br>

After that, I made salads to last me the entire week, tried to get PS2 Emulation to work (I eventually did, although I need to do more extensive testing before I can trumpet that fact in a blog post tutorial), got this blog post typed out, and now I'm not sure how to spend the rest of my day. I guess that's that.
